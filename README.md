# noise-simulator
This is a repository containing my submission for the Quantum Open Source Foundation mentorship program cohort 10 screening task. I chose task 2 "Noise, noise and more noise".

Each file contains the answer to one part of the problem:

1. Noise model: noise_simulator.py
2. Gate basis: circuit_decomposer.py
3. Adding two numbers with a quantum computer: quantum_adder.py
4. Effects of noise on quantum addition: main.py, results.pdf
