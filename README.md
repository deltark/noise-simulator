# noise-simulator
This is a repository containing my submission for the Quantum Open Source Foundation mentorship program cohort 10 screening task. I chose task 2 "Noise, noise and more noise".

Each file contains the answer to one part of the problem:

1. Noise model: noise_simulator.py
2. Gate basis: circuit_decomposer.py
3. Adding two numbers with a quantum computer: quantum_adder.py
4. Effects of noise on quantum addition: main.py, results.pdf

NOTE : Seeing the absolute state of qiskit right now after 2 years of not having to use it, I had to somehow put together code and versions that work with Aer, so it's not the latest qiskit version.

* qiskit 1.2.1
* qiskit-aer 0.15.1
* matplotlib 3.9.2
* numpy 2.1.2
